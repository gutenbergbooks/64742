<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>A
SERMON,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ETC.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Micah</span>, <span class="smcap">vi</span>, 9.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hear ye the rod</i>, <i>and Who hath appointed
it</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We believe that there is a <span class="smcap">God</span>:
that this <span class="smcap">God</span> is the Maker and
Preserver of all things visible and invisible; that He does now
and ever shall rule over all as He has done from the beginning;
that He calls the stars by name and numbers the very hairs of our
heads; so that nothing, great or small, happens in heaven or
earth but by His will or permission.&nbsp; We believe that His
rule is exercised, not simply in the maintenance of fixed laws,
always working the same ends by the same means, but also, in
active special interferences in particular cases.&nbsp; We
believe <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> rule to be a
strictly moral one, that is to say, that He ever recognises and
rewards what is right, and condemns and punishes what is
wrong.&nbsp; His times of interference, it is true, are not
always such as we should fix on.&nbsp; He often allows
righteousness to be long without its rewards, and wickedness
without its punishment.&nbsp; In the case of the individual,
reward may be deferred till he enters the future state which
awaits him; and so may punishment; or, it may be immediately
consequent upon the act which has earned it: while not
unfrequently the moral law may seem even to be for a time
inverted by the prosperity of the wicked or the adversity of the
godly&mdash;<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span><span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> patience long
bears with the wilful, while His love quickly chastens the weak
but willing.&nbsp; In the case of nations, the same discipline
seems to be observed; only, as they have but a temporal
existence, they are always ultimately dealt with <i>here</i>
according to their deserts.&nbsp; For a time, indeed, what <span
class="smcap">God</span> is pleased to account a righteous nation
may for their shortcomings and offences be abased and troubled;
but ere long it will be exalted: while a sinful people, though
they wax strong and are counted the excellent, and mighty, and
honourable of the earth, shall soon know terribly that sin is a
reproach and an everlasting destruction.</p>
<p>In administering temporal reward and punishment, <span
class="smcap">God</span> does not call into being new elements,
out of which to construct His instruments; but He avails Himself
of what already exist, either directing, perhaps diverting,
natural agencies, or making the dispositions or doings of men,
the ministers of His providence.&nbsp; It is thus that He orders
rain to make the earth fruitful or to flood it: wind to waft
health or to bring pestilence: lightning to ripen the fruit or to
blast the tree.&nbsp; It is thus, too, that He rewards the
well-doers, out of their good thoughts and ways, and punishes
sinners out of their lusts and evil pursuits, making men&rsquo;s
own hearts and lives to be their friends or enemies.</p>
<p>These are the well-established principles of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> moral government&mdash;universal
in their application, unfailing in their effects.&nbsp; In
applying them now to the case of nations, let us remember that
each nation has a purpose appointed by <span
class="smcap">God</span> to answer&mdash;a course to
follow.&nbsp; It may or it may not answer that purpose and follow
that course.&nbsp; If it does, it is blessed with prosperity; if
it does not, calamity will fall upon it; and, if one and another
chastisement, one and another call to repentance and amendment,
prove fruitless, utter destruction is its inevitable doom.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thus <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; If ye will not
hearken to <span class="smcap">Me</span>, to walk in my law,
which I have set before you, to hearken to the words of My
servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up
early, and sending them, but ye have not hearkened; then will I
make this house like Shiloh&rdquo; (which at that time lay
desolate), &ldquo;and will make this city a curse to all the
nations of the earth.&rdquo; (Jer., xxvi, 4&ndash;6.)&nbsp; The
kingdom of Judah was on a last trial when thus addressed by the
prophet Jeremiah.&nbsp; Calamity after calamity had fallen upon
it, combining chastisement and warning.&nbsp; Prophets had been
sent to interpret these calamities, to reprove the people for
their transgressions and to exhort them to amendment, with the
promise of consequent restoration to Divine favour; but all was
in vain: they would not see, they would not hear, they would not
return; and so within two years Jerusalem was &ldquo;an heap of
stones, and her king and people were wailing captives beside the
river of Babylon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A warning this, and a very solemn one, to all nations; but
more especially to ours, my brethren, because we seem to be
chosen like the Jews to be a peculiar people to the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>&mdash;our privileges are higher, and
consequently our responsibilities greater, than those of other
nations.&nbsp; If sin is a reproach to <i>any</i> people, we are
sure it must be a crying offence in <i>us</i>: for what nation is
there that hath <span class="smcap">God</span> so nigh unto them
as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> our <span
class="smcap">God</span> is to us in all things that we call upon
Him for?&nbsp; And if He has drawn us thus nigh to Him, does He
not require us more than others to draw nigh to Him?&nbsp; If we
are, as we boast of being, &ldquo;the temple of the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>,&rdquo; surely we shall be more
displeasing to Him than un-consecrated ground, if we become a den
of thieves or a house of unholy traffic.&nbsp; He has exalted us
to be the first of nations in religious, political, and social
privileges.&nbsp; He has done great things for us.&nbsp; He
therefore expects much of us.&nbsp; If, then, we grow unmindful
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>of Him, and
nationally dishonour His holy name, whereby we are called, either
by neglect or transgression, we may expect His rod of
chastisement, His visitation of judgment.&nbsp; In some of the
ways in which He afflicted His people of old, He will afflict us,
and with the same design; for a long time, to correct us and
restore us to obedience and so to favour; but ultimately, if we
refuse to be reformed, to make us feel the weight of His wrath
and to cause us to cease from among the nations of the
earth.&nbsp; I am not going to adduce proofs that <span
class="smcap">God</span> so deals with nations.&nbsp; Every
reader of the Bible can find them for himself.&nbsp; He has but
to study in Scripture light the history of kingdoms, to ascertain
beyond a doubt that righteousness ever exalts a nation, and that
sin is ever the reproach, and sin persisted in ever the ruin of
any people; and that by <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
irreversible appointment and by His superintending
Providence.&nbsp; Now this knowledge we may use in two
ways.&nbsp; Anticipating the effect from the cause, we may deter
ourselves from national sin, by considering that its commission
will surely provoke a national judgment: or looking back from the
effect to its cause, we may find in national judgments a sure
indication that as a people we have displeased <span
class="smcap">God</span>, that there is something in us which He
would correct and punish.</p>
<p>We shall not be at a loss to ascertain what are national
judgments, if we bear in mind that in Scripture they are
represented as identical with national calamities.&nbsp; Anything
that affects the honour, the influence, the lives, the resources
of our people is a judgment, of mercy or wrath&mdash;of mercy it
will prove, if we heed it; of wrath if we heed it not.&nbsp;
When, then, a famine starves our people, or a pestilence cuts
them off, or an enemy assails them, or they are involved in an
aggressive war, or perplexed by civil commotions and intestine
broils, we may be sure that <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span><span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
judgment is upon the earth, that He is requiring us to learn
righteousness, or to eat the fruits of iniquity.&nbsp; War in all
its forms, aggressive, defensive, or intestine, is assuredly a
Divine judgment.&nbsp; It may be, often is, that the sword is put
into a people&rsquo;s hand for them to use as the soldiers of
<span class="smcap">God</span>: but that sword is always
two-edged, wounding those who wield it as well as those on whom
it falls.&nbsp; To be thus enlisted in the service of <span
class="smcap">God</span> should never be the source of
self-gratulation or be regarded as a proof of Divine
favour.&nbsp; It is a calamity (that is, a Divine judgment), even
when we maintain the righteous cause of a weak ally, or defend
ourselves from a wanton aggressor, or put down our wickedly
rebellious subjects.&nbsp; Assyria&rsquo;s hosts in fighting
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> battles were made to
punish themselves.&nbsp; Israel had no warfare to wage when <span
class="smcap">God</span> was well pleased with it, but only when
it required correction.&nbsp; And we, my brethren, in our last
two righteous wars, had surely proofs enough in the loss of our
best blood, the drain upon our resources, the griefs, the
anxieties, the perplexities, that to be <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> agents of vengeance is no
privilege to be coveted; that is a scourge, a fearful scourge,
which a <span class="smcap">God</span> who never afflicts
willingly&mdash;that is, in mere caprice&mdash;would not have
laid upon us, had we not needed chastisement, had we not provoked
Him to displeasure.</p>
<p>And what shall we say of that which is uppermost in all
men&rsquo;s minds and foremost on all their tongues at this
time&mdash;our warfare in India?&nbsp; Is our part therein a
righteous one?&nbsp; Assuredly.&nbsp; Do those to whom we are
opposed merit the severest chastisement our sword can inflict on
them?&nbsp; Who dare doubt it?&nbsp; Does <span
class="smcap">God</span> call on us to punish them, in His name
and as His deputies?&nbsp; We all reverently believe that He
does.&nbsp; Is it then all glory, all privilege, all
favour&mdash;that we are thus employed?&nbsp; Surely the many
disasters, the sad, sad troubles we have <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>already
encountered, the further troubles which, without a
prophet&rsquo;s skill, we can see to be awaiting us, must
convince us to the contrary.&nbsp; The famine-stricken garrison
allowed by Him who can save by few as well as by many, who can
give food from Heaven, or sustain without it, to yield itself to
the foully treacherous foe&mdash;the pestilence-stricken band of
noble, righteous warriors checked in their good career&mdash;are
these proofs of <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> unmingled
approbation?&nbsp; Would He without a purpose ever have allowed
such contending elements as Hindooism and Mohammedanism to
combine against us?&nbsp; Would He who restrained this ripe
rebellion when our forces were elsewhere doing His work, have
given a loose to it now, had He deemed us worthy of His
constantly protective power?&nbsp; Would not He, who in some
cases has caused a mere handful of men to put to flight a host, a
woman to keep at bay a score of infuriated agents of
Satan&mdash;would not He have led us in all cases to easy
triumph&mdash;have crowned us long since with complete bloodless
victory and trampled all those that hate us under our uninjured
feet&mdash;had we not deserved the rod of chastisement?&nbsp; By
His occasional intervention on our behalf, He has vindicated the
general righteousness of our cause, and manifested His power to
help us when He will.&nbsp; Would not that aid, then, have been
more frequent, would it not have been constant, had we so
deserved to conquer?&nbsp; Recollect (it cannot be too strongly
or too frequently impressed upon you) <span
class="smcap">God</span> is free from all caprice; He does not
afflict without a cause.&nbsp; He may and does spare when we
deserve punishment; He cannot afflict without provocation.</p>
<p>In thus tracing effects to their causes, I am not pointing at
the calamities which have befallen individuals, further than as
illustrations of the general judgment.&nbsp; They were not
sinners above the rest of men, upon whom the tower in Siloam
fell.&nbsp; The <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>wicked man often lives on in outward prosperity and comes
in no misfortune like other folk; while the righteous is
afflicted and goes mourning all his days, or is cut off in the
midst of them.&nbsp; Inoffensive women, innocent children, godly
servants of the Cross have endured unspeakable agonies, and gone
dishonoured before men to the grave; while unbelievers, and
blasphemers, and licentious, have, perchance, escaped unhurt,
unassailed.&nbsp; No matter: a <i>future</i> state will set that
right&mdash;Lazarus is comforted&mdash;Dives has as yet his good
things; but if he haste not to repent, he will ere long be
tormented.&nbsp; But, as before urged, there is no future state
for nations.&nbsp; Their visitations therefore are always
judicial; and when, as in our present case, they are full of
calamity, it is clearly manifest that they are the fruit of
sin.</p>
<p>And cannot any reflecting mind, informed of our manner of rule
in India, discern the nature and point to the instances of our
provoking sin?&nbsp; A wonderful Providence has made us, on most
easy terms, possessors of a territory abounding in all kinds of
riches: we have brought home thence great stores of treasure: we
have found there lucrative and desirable employment for our
children, who in their turn have been enabled to make ample
provision for their families, and we have reaped there many other
advantages.&nbsp; With the soil, we have acquired dominion over
some two hundred millions of human beings, possessed like
ourselves of immortal souls, and destined to inherit an eternal
state of bliss or woe, according as they shall have pleased or
displeased <span class="smcap">God</span> in the flesh.&nbsp; We
found these natives sunk in various forms of the most degrading
superstition, gratifying (as they thought <i>religiously</i>) the
most grovelling lusts, and practising the most inhuman
rites.&nbsp; At the time when our chartered merchants took
possession of the ground they had purchased for warehouse room,
the full glare of the <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Gospel-light shone upon us.&nbsp; The
semi-darkness of Popery had been dispelled.&nbsp; It was the
triumph-day of the Reformation.</p>
<p>Now, it is a first principle of the Gospel (which we had then
no excuse for not understanding), that none of us lives for
himself; that a candle is not lighted to be hid under a bushel;
that what we have received, Christian love and Christian duty
require us to impart.&nbsp; Yet we traded with these benighted
people, and lived among them, without allowing them to see the
faintest glimmer of the true light.&nbsp; By and by, we became
their masters, or rather stewards over them for God.&nbsp; We
knew the religious responsibilities which rest upon the rulers of
a household, we could not plead ignorance of the duties of
stewards; still, not only did we refrain from discharging these
duties by instructing and regulating those of whom we had the
charge, but we actually ignored in their sight our own
recognition of God, and our own personal responsibility to a
Divine Master.&nbsp; So that they not unnaturally judged that we
were infidels, acknowledging no religious faith at all.&nbsp; It
was a common remark made on all sides, &ldquo;When an Englishman
goes to India, he leaves his religion at the
Cape&rdquo;&mdash;because no sign of its having accompanied him
was ever witnessed.</p>
<p>And this, be it observed, was not because the servants
wantonly disregarded their employers&rsquo; injunctions.&nbsp; It
is recorded in history against the East India Company (and I need
not tell you that the responsibility does not rest wholly on
them), that they never sought to make converts to Christianity,
but only to get money in India.&nbsp; Nor, my brethren, is this a
crime, a dereliction of most solemn duty chargeable on past ages
only.&nbsp; To this day and hour, no effort has been made by
authority to persuade the natives to become Christians.&nbsp;
Nay, worse; no clear exhibition of Christianity has been made to
them.&nbsp; <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>There are, it is true, three bishoprics in the country,
erected (and supported) by voluntary societies, when the tardy
permission was given.&nbsp; There are also Company&rsquo;s
chaplains at the various military stations, and there are some
few missionaries.&nbsp; But the whole number at the beginning of
the present outbreak was only in the proportion of one clergyman
to some eight or nine hundred thousand natives.&nbsp; I know that
some persons would object, that even this little show of
Christianity has been injurious to our tenure of the country;
that it has roused the suspicions of the jealous infidels, lest
they should be coerced into an acceptance of our
religion&mdash;that, in fact, it has caused the present
outbreak.&nbsp; My brethren, this statement is scarcely worthy of
a refutation.&nbsp; If it were, I could furnish it in the larger
attendance of native children at the Missionary schools where the
Bible is read, than at the Government schools from which it is
excluded; and in the candid testimony of unconverted Hindoos,
that their greatest suspicions of compulsory conversion was
founded on the timid, half-concealed profession of Christianity
by the English.&nbsp; But, my brethren, suppose it even so:
suppose that an attempt to proclaim Christianity did meet with
opposition, did provoke mutiny, is not this what it has ever had
to contend against?&nbsp; Should you and I be Christians this
day, if the brave missionaries who first came to our island had
desisted at the earliest menace or murmur of the Ancient Britons
or Anglo-Saxons?&nbsp; O let no such vain and impious excuse be
made!&nbsp; We are bound as a Christian nation to exhibit
Christianity to all our subjects; or, at any rate, to encourage
the efforts of societies and individuals to do it.&nbsp; We must
do it discreetly, but it must be done.&nbsp; How else shall we
give account of our stewardship&mdash;that stewardship entrusted
to us for the good of our subjects?&nbsp; But, my brethren, we
have not even brought moral influences to bear <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>upon this
people.&nbsp; In our country every one is bound at least to obey
the common law, and so is he (as far as I know), in all our
dependencies, <i>save in India</i>.&nbsp; But there (some
restraints have of late years been laid on them) infanticide,
widow-burning, wholesale polygamy, and many other equally
flagrant crimes have been tolerated, nay, deliberately
sanctioned, because, forsooth, they are part of the Mohammedan or
Hindoo religion.</p>
<p>Do we not deserve a judgment for this?&nbsp; And have we not
got it, alas! <i>in kind</i>?&nbsp; We have left the Mohammedan
to believe that it is heavenly to gratify lust, that it is
meritorious to kill the disbeliever in his prophet.&nbsp; We have
left the Hindoo (till lately) to destroy the widow, to murder the
infant.&nbsp; And has not this had its influence in the treatment
of our outraged and murdered ones&mdash;the men of peace, as well
as the warriors, the women and the helpless babes?</p>
<p>This is not the place, nor am I the person to discuss at
length the causes and cure of the Indian mutiny.&nbsp; My aim has
only been to give you some glimpses of it in its religious light;
and so to help you to see <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
hand in it, that you may seek relief from Him; and, according to
your several opportunities, take counsel and use efforts to avert
this judgment, and others, of which, if neglected, this will be
the sure forerunner.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hear ye the rod, and Who hath
appointed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With such sense of our neglect of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> work, and our fearful
responsibility to Him, let us draw near to the Throne of Mercy on
this Solemn Fast Day.&nbsp; Let us humble ourselves as a people
for the aggregate of this sin, and as individuals, for the shares
in it, which by our deeds, our influence, our voice, our silence,
we have respectively had.&nbsp; Let us consider, too, that as
this wound in a &ldquo;member,&rdquo; affects the whole
&ldquo;body,&rdquo; so may it have been inflicted <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>for the sins
of the whole body.&nbsp; The moral corruption, the tolerated, the
sanctioned, the <i>justified</i> sins of this land, the general
disregard of <span class="smcap">God</span> as the administrator
of temporal affairs, the unwilling acknowledgment, often
withheld, of responsibility to Him; the sins like in kind to
those which now excite our horror and indignation, the deceit and
fraud, the atrocious murders, the daring deeds of uncleanness,
the reckless meddling with the sacred law of marriage here at
home&mdash;who shall say that this unhealthy state of the
&ldquo;body&rdquo; has not helped to cause the sore in the
&ldquo;member&rdquo;?&nbsp; And who shall not acknowledge that it
is of Divine Mercy that that sore has not broken out in a more
vital part?&nbsp; O then, as we &ldquo;hear the rod, and Who hath
appointed it,&rdquo; let us not only submissively receive the
chastisement, but also humbly and thankfully adore the clemency,
which has made it so much lighter than we deserved.</p>
<p>But this is a day of requests as well as
acknowledgments.&nbsp; We have to make our humble petitions to
Almighty God; and to be acceptable petitioners, we must offer
righteous prayers&mdash;righteous, not simply in the feeling that
we merit punishment, that we do not merit mercy; but in the
resolution to provoke punishment no longer; to deserve, by
appreciating and turning to godly advantage, the supplicated
mercy.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have done wrong, we repent, we pledge
ourselves to amend:&rdquo; in this tone do we pray for peace and
the restoration of our dominion; at least if we do not, the
intelligent Christian must devoutly hope that our prayers may not
be answered.&nbsp; Better, far better would it be, much as the
worldly-wise will deride the folly of the assertion, that we
should lose India altogether, than that it should be given back
to us in anger; than that it should be again a wide field, on
which to display our contempt of Christianity&rsquo;s strongest
obligations: we the holders of a gift, which not to hand on is to
lose, seeming not to <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>know that we have that gift: we the
soldiers of the Cross to connive at, to sanction, and so to adopt
and establish the dominion of Satan!&nbsp; O, as you pray for the
success of our soldiers&rsquo; arms, asking that they may prevail
and execute justice (<i>not revenge</i>) and restore peace, let
it be with the resolution that so soon as the fitting time
arrives, your voice, and influence, and means shall do their
utmost to send out a spiritual army, to obtain a better conquest,
to set up a more glorious dominion, to secure a more lasting and
effectual peace wherein righteousness shall reign!</p>
<p>Meantime, let us not forget&mdash;oh, their case will bear no
delay!&mdash;the immediate sufferers under the Divine
displeasure.&nbsp; Too many, alas! have already drunk the
bitterest dregs of our cup of visitation.&nbsp; Brutally treated,
savagely murdered, it is too late to do anything for them.&nbsp;
But there are many whom danger as yet but threatens; whom
fiendish lust and cruelty are seeking to grasp and victimise;
whom the sword may smite or the pestilence lay low, or the famine
starve.&nbsp; What can we do for them?&nbsp; I am not asking what
the Government is to do for them: they know their work, and seem
fully bent on doing it: but what can we, as individual
Christians, here at home do?&nbsp; What, my brethren, but pray
for them?&nbsp; Besiege the throne of <span
class="smcap">God</span> daily: intreat Him, if it is needful to
smite us yet longer with His rod, at least to bear less heavily
on the innocent and helpless, to prepare those whom He wills to
take, for death and the judgment that comes after death; to
sanctify their sufferings; to comfort those who mourn for
them.</p>
<p>And something else remains for us to do.&nbsp; There are
sufferers in this sad mutiny who have escaped with life, but
nothing else.&nbsp; We read of crowds of them, helpless babes
without nurse or mother; gentle, delicate women, accustomed to
all the comforts <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>of life, huddled together in one room&mdash;their hearts
torn with the loss of those they loved&mdash;their minds
distracted with the remembrance of the atrocities they have
witnessed&mdash;perhaps experienced&mdash;their bodies enfeebled,
if not diseased, through their unspeakable
hardships&mdash;without a comfort of any kind, or the means of
procuring it!&nbsp; You know what to do for them.&nbsp; You know
the value and power of sympathy timely shown in relieving pain,
in binding up the wounds of the heart.&nbsp; In the name of the
Great Sympathiser be not slow to manifest that sympathy in all
possible ways; and as a substantial proof that you have it, lose
no time in sending your contributions to the Fund which is to
relieve their most pressing wants.</p>
<p>I will not do you wrong by supposing that you need words of
mine to urge you to this duty.&nbsp; If the knowledge of the
facts which you possess did not move you, it were vain to expect
that any reasoning, any expostulation, any entreaty would
avail.&nbsp; Whoso hath this world&rsquo;s goods, and seeth his
brother in <i>such</i> need, and shutteth up his compassion from
him, how dwelleth the love of <span
class="smcap">God</span>&mdash;or anything else excellent or
human&mdash;in him?</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the

claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
